As an enhancement to the existing requirements I have displayed the orders taken, based on the priority of its serving.
That is along with the name of the food item and price, the priority of its serving is to be given as input.
This will assist Emeril in deciding which orders to be served first.
 
For example, A starter would have priorty 1, main course would have priority 2 and a desert would have priority 3 (1 being highest priority and 3 being least). The items displayed would be in the order in which they have to be served.
